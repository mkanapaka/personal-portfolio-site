# Portfolio site
This is a portfolio website built for a Product Manager and styled using Tailwind CSS.

I have created a sleek nav bar with a hero section, about section, work section, projects section and contact section. It also has a fixed footer with socials and logo. The scrolling is smooth and the site is also responsive for browsers on large and mobile devices. 

# Usage

# License
